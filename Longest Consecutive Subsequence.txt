Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
Output:
6
Explanation:
The consecutive numbers here
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 
numbers form the longest consecutive
subsquence.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
a[] = {1,9,3,10,4,20,2}
Output:
4
Explanation:
1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest
consecutive subsequence.

    int findLongestConseqSubseq(int arr[], int N)
    {
      //Your code here
      sort(arr,arr+N);
      int max=1;int count=1;
      int prev=arr[0];
      for(int i=1;i<N;i++){
          if(arr[i]==prev){
              continue;
          }
          else if(arr[i]==prev+1){
              count++;
          }
          else{
              count=1;
          }
          prev=arr[i];
          if(count>max){
              max=count;
          }
      }
      return max;
    }
